# Youtube Compilation Helper
MIT Licensed Open Source extension for Google Chrome by Xavier Duthil.  

This extension provides useful functionalities when watching music-compilation videos on Youtube.  
It works by scanning for a timestamped tracklist in the video description and uses it to build its own interactive tracklist.

## Functionalities
- Show current track's name
- Media controls (play, pause, rewind, fast-forward)
- Go to previous/next track buttons

## More to come (eventually)
- Settings
- Multi tab interaction (use the media controls from any tab)
- Support of hardware media keys
- Discrete video progression bar
- Automatically pop up when a compilation video is detected (configurable)

## Installation
You can either:
- Install it from the Google Chrome Webstore (link to come)
- Download the source, then in your Google Chrome's extension tab (URI: `chrome://extensions/`) use the "Load unpacked extension" button to select the project's folder
- Download the package (file to come), then drag & drop this file into your Google Chrome's extension tab (URI: `chrome://extensions/`)

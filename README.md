# Youtube Compilation Helper
MIT-licensed open source extension for Google Chrome and Chromium by Xavier Duthil.  

This extension provides useful functionalities when watching music-compilation videos on Youtube.  
It works by scanning for a timestamped tracklist in the video description and uses it to build its own interactive tracklist.
